<b>Collaborative decks!</b>

You can now create custom decks with your friends! Just add your friend in Overloaded (must be mutual friendship), star his deck and ask him to make you a collaborator of that deck.
Collaborators can view the private deck they are collaborating to, add, edit and remove cards.

This feature is available for Overloaded users only.
