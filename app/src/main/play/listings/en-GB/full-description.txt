This app let's you play Pretend You're Xyzzy, an online card game, on your device wherever you are. 

----- ATTENTION! -----
This app content may disappoint some people. If you don't agree with the content of this app, don't complain with me. I'm not the creator of this game, just a player who is also a developer.
--------------------------------

The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.
